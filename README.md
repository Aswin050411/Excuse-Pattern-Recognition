git clone <repository-url>
cd "final year"
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- Flask
- psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL adapter)
- scikit-learn (AI/ML features)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- joblib (model serialization)
- python-docx (report generation)
- reportlab (PDF export)

3. **Configure database**
Update `repository/db.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'dbname': 'your_database',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 5432
}
```

4. **Initialize database**
Run the SQL schema from `schema.sql` to create tables.

5. **Run the application**
```bash
python run.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
